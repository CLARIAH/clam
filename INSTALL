(NOTE: PLEASE CONSULT THE CLAM MANUAL FOR MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON INSTALLATION!)

CLAM INSTALLATION 
==================

Easy install is part of the Python setup tools and can install CLAM globally on
your system for you from the Python Package Index. This is the easiest method
of installing CLAM, as it will automatically fetch and install any
dependencies.  This procedure downloads CLAM for you automatically.

 $ sudo pip3 install clam

If you already downloaded CLAM manually (cloning from github), you can do:

 $ sudo python3 setup.py install

If pip is not yet installed on your system, install it using: 
 on debian-based linux systems (including Ubuntu): 
  $ apt-get install python3-pip
  
on RedHat-based linux distributions: 
  $ yum install python3-pip

Note that sudo/root access is needed to install globally. Ask your system administrator
to install it.  We recommend using a Python Virtual Environment to install CLAM locally.
 
 $ virtualenv --python=pá»³thon3 env 
 $ . env/bin/activate
 (env)$ pip3 install clam


RUNNING A TEST WEBSERVICE
===========================

If you installed CLAM using the above method, then you can launch a clam test
webservice using the development server as follows:

$ clamservice -H localhost -p 8080 clam.config.textstats
 
Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 and verify everything works

If any problems occur during installation regarding pycurl, then install the
pycurl package supplied by your distribution (python-pycurl on Debian/ubuntu)

Note: It is important to regularly keep CLAM up to date as fixes and
improvements are implemented on a regular basis. Update CLAM using: 

 $ pip3 install -U clam
