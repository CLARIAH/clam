PLEASE CONSULT THE CLAM MANUAL FOR MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON INSTALLATION!


== INSTRUCTIONS USING EASY INSTALL ==

Easy install is part of the Python setup tools and can install CLAM globally on your system for you from the Python Package Index. This is the easiest method of installing CLAM, as it will automatically fetch and install any dependencies.  This procedure downloads CLAM for you, rather than using a pre-downloaded archive! 

$ sudo easy_install clam

(sudo/root access is needed to install globally. For installation in a local custom path, use -d, this owever complicates matters as you need to take care to add these local directories to your python library path:

$ easy_install -d /path/to/dir clam

If easy_install is not yet installed on your system, install it using:
 on debian-based linux systems (including Ubuntu):
  $ apt-get install python-setuptools
 on RPM-based linux systems:
  $ yum install python-setuptools
 on MacOS X:
  (follow the manual steps below instead)

If you installed using this method, then you can (globally) launch a clam webservice using the development server as follows:

$ clamservice -H localhost -p 8080 clam.config.textstats
 
 Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 and verify everything works



If any problems occur during installation regarding pycurl, then install the pycurl package supplied by your distribution (python-pycurl on Debian/ubuntu)

Note: It is important to regularly keep CLAM up to date as fixes and improvements are implemented on a regular basis. Simply issue a 'git pull' in your CLAM directory to obtain the latest modifications from the github repository. 


 
== MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAC OS X USERS ==

(Note: These instructions may a bit outdated and lengty, but should work. The recommended route however is to install the python setuptools and then use easy_install as per the above instructions. )

1) Install the Apple Developer Tools (available as a seperate install
    on the Apple installation DVD) as well as X11 if it's not installed
    yet. 
    
2) Install either fink or macports (http://www.macports.org/), if not available yet.

3) Obtain python 2.6 (*not* 3.x;  2.7 will do too)
 For macports users, grab it from macports or directly from http://python.org/download
 For fink users: $sudo fink install python 

4) Open a Terminal and install the following dependencies:
 Macports:
  $ sudo port install py26-lxml        (or py25, py27)
  $ sudo port install py26-curl        
  $ sudo port install git-core
 Fink:
  $ sudo fink install lxml-py26  (or lxml-py27 or lxml-py25 depending on your python version)
  $ sudo fink install pycurl-py26
  $ sudo fink install git

4) Make and go to a directory where you want to add clam
 $ mkdir ~/clam/
 $ cd ~/clam/

5) Retrieve CLAM from github using git:
$ git clone git://github.com/proycon/clam.git
 
6) Retrieve Web.py from github using git:
 $ git clone git://github.com/webpy/webpy.git
 
 Set some symlinks so web.py can be found:
 $ cd clam
 $ ln -s ../webpy/web
 $ cd common
 $ ln -s ../web
 $ cd ..

7) Start the demo service
 $ ./clamservice.py -H localhost -p 8080 clam.config.textstats
 
 Navigate your browser too to http://localhost:8080 and verify everything works

ERRORS?
 Error importing lxml even though you succesfully installed it? There may be multiple pythons on your machine, python may not be the same as python2.6 or python2.5. Try python2.6 or python2.5 explicitly:

 Change 'python' to 'python2.6' in the first line (hashbang) of clamservice.py and the wrapper script you want to use (i.e. clam/config/textstats.py), then try again:
 
Note: It is important to regularly keep CLAM up to date as fixes and improvements are implemented on a regular basis. Simply issue a 'git pull' in your CLAM directory to obtain the latest modifications from the github repository.

== INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS USERS == 

 1) Delete Windows and install a decent OS ;)
