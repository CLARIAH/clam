CLAM Client API
==================================

The CLAM Client API enables users to quickly write clients to interact with CLAM webservices of any kind. It is an abstraction layer over all lower-level network communication. Consult also the CLAM Data API, as responses returned by the webservice are almost always instantiated as CLAMData objects in the client.
